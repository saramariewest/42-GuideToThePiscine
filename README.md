## What is the 42 Piscine?
The Piscine (French for "swimming pool") is an intense 4-week coding bootcamp at 42 School, designed to test problem-solving skills and the ability to learn independently in a peer-driven environment.

## Notes & Learnings
I'll document useful commands, coding patterns, and solutions here as I progress. Feel free to explore.
